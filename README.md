# VICE

VICE is a personal time intelligence system that learns how a user actually works
and helps them plan realistically instead of optimistically.

## Core Idea
Most productivity tools assume perfect discipline.
VICE corrects planning bias by learning from real execution data.

## Stack
- Frontend: React + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Auth: JWT
- Intelligence Layer: Custom time prediction engine

## Status
🚧 In active development
